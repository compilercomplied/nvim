## Initial setup
Packer is not bootstraping correctly so it needs to be installed before anything else. If any errors arise during the initial packer install, comment the lua imports in the root `init.lua` except for the packer one.

## Typescript pre-requisites

1. Install [deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno).
